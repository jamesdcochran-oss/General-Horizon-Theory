# Predictive Toolkit — General Horizon Theory

**Heuristic:** If **Flow / Capacity ≳ 1**, a boundary (horizon) forms.

**Pillars:** Ratio • Leads (wind/dryness) • Lags (resource fatigue) • Soft Horizons (buffers/fuses).

## Example A — Hawaii wind-driven wildfire
**Watch:** Gusts ≥ 50–60 mph, FFWI ≥ 50, low RH; utility/vegetation interactions (ignition pressure).  
**Triggers:** high-risk circuit de-energization; upwind staging; corridor hardening & alerts.

## Example B — Bald Mountain, VA (Nov 2025)
**Watch:** NW gusts 25–40 mph on ridges, RH < 25–30%, elevated KBDI, 1-hr fuels receptive.  
**Triggers:** indirect + anchor/branch; lee-side closures; dozers/modules pre-positioned.

## Example C — Virginia Piedmont/Tidewater
**Watch:** FFWI ≥ 50, RH < 25–30%, multiple dry days; DOF “High/Very High”.  
**Triggers:** staggered patrols; surge engines/tenders; targeted public messaging.

Inputs: wind/temp/RH → **FFWI**; KBDI/rain-since → availability.  
Derived: SpreadPressure/Capacity gauge with **Elevated/Critical** badges.
